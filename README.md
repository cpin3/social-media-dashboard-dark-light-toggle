## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.**

## Things I've Learned

Learning how to do this challenge posed a lot of learning curves for me. So much so that I had to look at other people solutions and how to videos to even get a good grasp of where I wanted to start. 
My frontend coding leaves a lot to be desired so I plan to continue doing challenges like these to continue my growth in this space. The Toggle button by far was the toughest thing to get correctly. 
This partnered with the endless setup, debugging and editing left me astounded at the complexity of what seems to be a simple task.
